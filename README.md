# Aremedia Frontend Test
Requirements as listed here: https://gist.github.com/bxm-builduser/ae79b728b885971bd4e036a3b617acee 

# Installation:
  - clone repo locally (either use git clone OR download the zip and extract and open manually)
  - open in editor of choice 
  - run the command "npm install" 
  - after installing, run "npm start"
 
# Notes on Design
  - Tried replicating aremedia.com.au navbar (background color, font color and gradient from left to right on hover of Nav items) 
  - Implemented the video that autoplays, scrolling down will contain the rest of the content
  - Tried matching the main colors used (mainly #f1484f and white) 

# Improvements That Could be Made
  - Implement test suite with Jest + Enzyme
  - Plot out design better in Figma, Photoshop, etc
  - Ask more clarfying questions regarding layout and differences between viewports
  - Implement a better method for responsiveness for tablet 
    - Tablet design is a bit "hacky" due to some constraints and not having 100% understanding of Bootstrap
  - Implement the same font-family used by aremedia.com.au
 
# Test Suites
  - These will be generically outlined in how I would have implemented them (view as per the test files for the individual components)
